# NavDataLogger
Data Logger Software for INS and GPS sensors

All of the library folders for the Gyro, Mag, Accel, RTC and USB Host controller should be placed in the default arduino/libraries folder.

The GPS folder contains a sample sketch to stream the NMEA strings from the onboard Trimble unit.
The IMU folder contains a sample sketch to stream the pose and compass data from the 3 onboard mems chips.
